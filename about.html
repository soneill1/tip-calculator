        <p>Thank you so much for taking the time to visit calculate-tip.com. We hope our simple app makes it easier for you to tip the hardworking men and women in the food service industy. Did you know that in the U.S. restuarants are not required to pay
          server's minimum wage?</p>

        <p>This means that many of these individual's salary's are dependent entirely on tips. While there are no set rules for tipping, why not make someones day today and tip a little more than usual? If your server was exceptional please let them know.
          A few extra dollars to help someone working hard, can really make their day and validate their effort. Trust me you will feel good too.</p>

        <p>We appreciate your support for our site, if you have any feedback please visit the contact section. We would love to hear from you.</p>
